    | This is the configuration file for Maven. It can be specified at two levels:
    |
    |  1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user,
    |                 and is normally provided in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml.
    |
    |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
    |
    |                 -s /path/to/user/settings.xml
    |
    |  2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all Maven
    |                 users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same Maven
    |                 installation). It's normally provided in
    |                 ${maven.conf}/settings.xml.
    |
    |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
    |
    |                 -gs /path/to/global/settings.xml
    |
    | The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start at
    | getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate, the default
    | values (values used when the setting is not specified) are provided.

      | when invoking a command line like "mvn prefix:goal". Maven will automatically add the group identifiers
      | "org.apache.maven.plugins" and "org.codehaus.mojo" if these are not already contained in the list.

        <!-- server
        | Specifies the authentication information to use when connecting to a particular server, identified by
        | a unique name within the system (referred to by the 'id' attribute below).
        |
        | NOTE: You should either specify username/password OR privateKey/passphrase, since these pairings are

      <!-- mirrors
      | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
      |
      | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.
      | However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
      | it to several places.
      |
      | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
      | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
      | server for that repository.
      |-->
      <mirrors>
        <!-- mirror
        | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository. The repository that
        | this mirror serves has an ID that matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used
        | for inheritance and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.
        |
        <mirror>
          <id>mirrorId</id>
          <mirrorOf>repositoryId</mirrorOf>
          <name>Human Readable Name for this Mirror.</name>
          <url>http://my.repository.com/repo/path</url>
        </mirror>
        -->
      </mirrors>
      <!-- profiles
      | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
      | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
      | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
      |
      | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where
      | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is
      | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.
      |
      | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles
      | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially
      | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,
      | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a
      | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.
      | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
      |
      | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
      |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
      |       variables for plugins in the POM.
      |
      |-->
      <profiles>
        <!-- profile
        | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the
        | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/>
        | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
        |
        | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention
        | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.
        | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting
        | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.
        |
        | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.
        <profile>
          <id>jdk-1.4</id>
          <activation>
            <jdk>1.4</jdk>
          </activation>
          <repositories>
            <repository>
              <id>jdk14</id>
              <name>Repository for JDK 1.4 builds</name>
              <url>http://www.myhost.com/maven/jdk14</url>
              <layout>default</layout>
              <snapshotPolicy>always</snapshotPolicy>
            </repository>
          </repositories>
        </profile>
        -->
        <!--
        | Here is another profile, activated by the system property 'target-env' with a value of 'dev',
        | which provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance. To use this, your plugin configuration
        | might hypothetically look like:
        |
        | ...
        | <plugin>
        |   <groupId>org.myco.myplugins</groupId>
        |   <artifactId>myplugin</artifactId>
        |
        |   <configuration>
        |     <tomcatLocation>${tomcatPath}</tomcatLocation>
        |   </configuration>
        | </plugin>
        | ...
        |
        | NOTE: If you just wanted to inject this configuration whenever someone set 'target-env' to
        |       anything, you could just leave off the <value/> inside the activation-property.
        |
        <profile>
          <id>env-dev</id>
          <activation>
            <property>
              <name>target-env</name>
              <value>dev</value>
            </property>
          </activation>
          <properties>
            <tomcatPath>/path/to/tomcat/instance</tomcatPath>
          </properties>
        </profile>
        -->
      </profiles>
      <!-- activeProfiles
      | List of profiles that are active for all builds.
